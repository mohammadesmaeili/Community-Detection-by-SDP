### Semidefinite Programming for Community Detection with Side Information (Unsupervised Learning Task)
# 
This paper produces an efficient Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solution for community detection that incorporates both graph data as well as non-graph data.
semidefinite programming is known as an efficient solution for standard community detection on graphs. We formulate a semi-definite relaxation for the maximum likelihood estimation of node labels, subject to observing both graph and non-graph data. This formulation is distinct from the semidefinite programming solution of standard community detection, but maintains its desirable properties. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for three types of non-graph information, which in this paper are called side information: partially revealed labels, noisy labels, as well as multiple observations (features) per node with arbitrary but finite cardinality. We find that semidefinite programming has the same exact recovery threshold in the presence of side information as maximum likelihood with side information. Thus, the methods developed herein are both computationally efficient as well as asymptotically accurate for the solution of community detection in the presence of side information. Simulations show that the asymptotic results of this paper can also shed light on the performance of semidefinite programming on graphs of modest size.
